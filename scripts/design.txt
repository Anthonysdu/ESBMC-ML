Agent: BMC tool.

Action: Decisions of unrolling depth to run the program.

Environment: Takes an action and returns the reward.

State: Current depth, verification result & time, history, program AST, cpu / memory usage..

Reward: Feedback of the action. 

E. g. :

small bound & verification failure: +5

Large bound & verification failure: +1

Large bound & unwinding assertion: -1

Small bound & unwinding assertion: -5

Discount factor

Policy: Decide which action to take to maximise reward (or greedy policy).

Value: Estimated reward of the state (Or use Neural Networks to predict value function).
